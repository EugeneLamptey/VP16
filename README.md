# VP16-inhibitors-pred
Welcome to the "Inhibitor Prediction for VP16 Using Machine Learning" project repository! This project focuses on harnessing the power of machine learning to predict potential inhibitors for VP16 protein. VP16 is a critical component in various biological processes, and the identification of inhibitors can have significant implications in both research and therapeutic applications.
VP16 is a viral protein that is significant in the replication of herpes Simplex virus (HSV). Aside it's crucial role in replication, it also helps HSV to reactivate after exhibiting its latent phase in a host.

This project involves the building of machine learning tools to predict compounds that can be used to inhibit VP16
Data from the project was obtained from PUBCHEM (AID 651615)

## Key Features:
  Predictive Models: We have developed sophisticated machine learning models that can analyze chemical compounds and predict whether they act as inhibitors for VP16.
  
  Data Preprocessing: Our project includes thorough data preprocessing techniques to ensure the quality and reliability of the dataset used for training and testing.
  
  Model Evaluation: We have implemented comprehensive model evaluation methods to assess the accuracy and performance of our predictive models.
  
  User-Friendly Interface: Our project includes user-friendly interfaces for researchers and scientists to easily input chemical compounds and receive inhibitor predictions.

  Note: the model used in predicting the inhibitors of VP16 is the random forest model on morgan descriptors
